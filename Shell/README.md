#Project Overview
Inventory_Scripts is a git repository to aggregate a number of scripts I've written, with the intent to make it easier to keep track of what's created and/ or running in any one of your (possibly) many AWS accounts... The scripts in this repo are discussed below.

**_Critical Note_**:  *If your profiles include the "region" within the profile section, these scripts will be limited to looking for resources ONLY WITHIN THAT REGION. There's no quick answer to this problem right now, since all cli commands are inherently regionally focused. Just something to bear in mind when running these scripts.*

## Profile Scripts
- **AllProfiles.sh**
  - This script displays all of your configured profiles, including in both your ```~/.aws/credentials``` file, as well as the ```~/.aws/config``` file.
- **my_account_number.sh**
  - This script simply shows you the account number for the account whose profile you specify at the command line.
- **profiles.sh**
  - This script shows you the account number for all profiles (accounts) in your ```~/.aws/credentials``` file.

## Config-like Discovery Scripts
- **Config-Discovered-Resources.sh**
